### Hi there, my name is Emil Lubomirov! 👋

I am a student who is learning programming mostly with Java, Java Script, MySQL. I live in Sofia, Bulgaria.

Since the end of 2017 I've been practicing and improving my software development skills. 
I have had the chance to work on some projects alone and in a team as well.

I'm constantly trying to grow and to learn new concepts. In my spare time I like going out with friends, 
riding a bike or just listening to music. 

### What I am focusing on? 👨‍💻

Currently trying to enrich fundamential programming concepts and the web based ones in particular with ReactJS and Spring Boot.
Looking for bigger projects to work on in a team.

### Find me elsewhere 🌎
